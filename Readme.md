# Fake BSOD Prank - STOP MESSING WITH MY LAPTOP!!!

## What is this?
This is a **fake Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)** that will randomly strike **once per startup**, anywhere between **1 minute and 60 minutes** after the laptop turns on. It's full-screen, unclosable, and looks exactly like a real Windows crash. **Good luck closing it, because Task Manager is gone, and Alt+F4 won't save you!**

## Why did I make this?
Because my **brothers won't stop using my laptop like maniacs**!!! Every time I step away, BOOMâ€”they're on it, clicking, gaming, downloading nonsense, and probably breaking things. This stops them cold. Nothing says "get off my laptop" like a terrifying blue screen with a fake critical error!

## How does it work?
1. **VBScript runs at startup** and picks a completely random moment (between 1 and 60 minutes) to execute the fake BSOD.
2. **Explorer.exe gets shut down** to make it look even more real.
3. **Task Manager is disabled**, so they can't escape.
4. **A PowerShell script launches full-screen**, displaying a legit-looking Windows BSOD.
5. **It "collects error info" from 0% to 100%** before "restarting" the computer.

## How to install (for maximum chaos)
1. Copy `system_update.vbs` and `sys_maintenance.ps1` to `C:\Users\YourUsername\`
2. Press **Win + R**, type `shell:startup`, and hit Enter.
3. Paste `system_update.vbs` into the **Startup folder**.
4. Restart and watch the panic unfold!

## How to stop it (IF YOU'RE ME)
- Run the restore script to bring everything back to normal automatically.

## The Best Part: BLAME THEM!
When they freak out, **act shocked and blame them for breaking the laptop!** Say things like:
- "WHAT DID YOU DO?!"
- "I told you not to mess with my laptop!"
- "You must have downloaded some virus!"
- "Great, now I have to get it repaired..."

Watch them panic and regret everything. **This is the ultimate payback for all their laptop abuse!**
